# Ethereum-Decentralized-Voting-Application

This is a one page application where a user can enter their ID and vote for a candidate. There will also be a button that counts and displays the number of votes per candidate. This project uses smart contracts to keep track of all the information of the voters and the candidates. 
Since a blockchain is a permanent record of transactions (votes) that are distributed, every vote can irrefutably be traced back to exactly when and where it happened without revealing the voter’s identity. In addition, past votes cannot be changed, while the present can’t be hacked, because every transaction is verified by every single node in the network. And any outside or inside attacker must have control of 51% of the nodes to alter the record.

Firstly, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. 
This program can also be executed on Remix IDE.
